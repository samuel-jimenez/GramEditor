# Outline Panel

In addition to the modal outline (`cmd-shift-o`), Gram has the _outline panel_.
The outline panel can be deployed via `cmd-shift-b` ({#action
outline_panel::ToggleFocus} via the command palette), or by clicking the
`Outline Panel` button in the status bar.

When viewing a "singleton" buffer (i.e., a single file on a tab), the outline
panel works similarly to that of the outline modal－it displays the outline of
the current buffer's symbols, as reported by [tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/).
Clicking on an entry jumps to the associated section in the file. The outline
view will also automatically scroll to the section associated with the current
cursor position within the file.

The outline view provides a way to quickly navigate to specific parts of the
code to help maintain context when working with large result sets in
multi-buffers.
