# Troubleshooting

This guide covers common troubleshooting techniques for Gram.
Sometimes you'll be able to identify and resolve issues on your own using this information.
Other times, troubleshooting means gathering the right information—logs, profiles, or reproduction steps—to help developers diagnose and fix the problem.

> **Note**: To open the command palette, use `cmd-shift-p` on macOS or `ctrl-shift-p` on Windows / Linux.

## Retrieve Gram and System Information

When reporting issues or seeking help, it's useful to know your Gram version and system specifications. You can retrieve this information using the following actions from the command palette:

- {#action gram::About}: Find your Gram version number
- {#action gram::CopySystemSpecsIntoClipboard}: Populate your clipboard with Gram version number, operating system version, and hardware specs

## Gram Log

Often, a good first place to look when troubleshooting any issue in Gram is the Gram log, which might contain clues about what's going wrong.
You can review the most recent 1000 lines of the log by running the {#action gram::OpenLog} action from the command palette.
If you want to view the full file, you can reveal it in your operating system's native file manager via {#action gram::RevealLogInFileManager} from the command palette.

You'll find the Gram log in the respective location on each operating system:

- macOS: `~/Library/Logs/Gram/Gram.log`
- Windows: `C:\Users\YOU\AppData\Local\Gram\logs\Gram.log`
- Linux: `~/.local/share/gram/logs/Gram.log` or `$XDG_DATA_HOME`

> Note: In some cases, it might be useful to monitor the log live, such as when [developing a Gram extension](gram://docs/extensions/developing-extensions).
> Example: `tail -f ~/Library/Logs/Gram/Gram.log`

The log may contain enough context to help you debug the issue yourself, or you may find specific errors that are useful when filing an issue.

## Performance Issues (Profiling)

If you're running into performance issues — such as hitches, hangs, or general unresponsiveness — having a performance profile will help zero in on what is getting stuck.

### macOS

Xcode Instruments (which comes bundled with [Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835)) is the standard tool for profiling on macOS.

1. With Gram running, open Instruments
1. Select `Time Profiler` as the profiling template
1. In the `Time Profiler` configuration, set the target to the running Gram process
1. Start recording
1. If the performance issue occurs when performing a specific action in Gram, perform that action now
1. Stop recording
1. Save the trace file

## Startup and Workspace Issues

Gram creates local SQLite databases to persist data relating to its workspace and your projects. These databases store, for instance, the tabs and panes you have open in a project, the scroll position of each open file, the list of all projects you've opened (for the recent projects modal picker), etc. You can find and explore these databases in the following locations:

- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Gram/db`
- Linux and FreeBSD: `~/.local/share/gram/db` (or within `XDG_DATA_HOME` or `FLATPAK_XDG_DATA_HOME`)
- Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Gram\db`

The naming convention of these databases takes on the form of `0-<release_channel>`:

- Stable: `0-stable`
- Dev: `0-dev`

While rare, we've seen a few cases where workspace databases became corrupted, which prevented Gram from starting.
If you're experiencing startup issues, you can test whether it's workspace-related by temporarily moving the database from its location, then trying to start Gram again.

> **Note**: Moving the workspace database will cause Gram to create a fresh one.
> Your recent projects, open tabs, etc. will be reset to "factory".

If your issue persists after regenerating the database, please file an issue.

## Language Server Issues

If you're experiencing language-server related issues, such as stale diagnostics or issues jumping to definitions, restarting the language server via {#action editor::RestartLanguageServer} from the command palette will often resolve the issue.
