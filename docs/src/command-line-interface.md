# Command-line Interface

Gram has a CLI, on Linux this should come with the distribution's Gram package (binary name can vary from distribution to distribution, `gram` will be used later for brevity).
For macOS, the CLI comes in the same package with the editor binary, and could be installed into the system with the `cli: install` Gram command which will create a symlink to the `/usr/local/bin/gram`.
It can also be built from source out of the `cli` crate in this repository.

Use `gram --help` to see the full list of capabilities.
General highlights:

- Opening another empty Gram window: `gram`

- Opening a file or directory in Gram: `gram /path/to/entry` (use `-n` to open in the new window)

- Reading from stdin: `ps axf | gram -`

- Starting Gram with logs in the terminal: `gram --foreground`

- Uninstalling Gram and all its related files: `gram --uninstall`
