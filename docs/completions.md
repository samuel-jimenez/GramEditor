# Completions

"Code Completions" provided by Language Servers (LSPs) automatically installed by Gram or via [Gram Language Extensions](languages.md).

## Language Server Code Completions {#code-completions}

When there is an appropriate language server available, Gram will provide completions of variable names, functions, and other symbols in the current file. You can disable these by adding the following to your Gram `settings.json` file:

```json [settings]
"show_completions_on_input": false
```

You can manually trigger completions with `ctrl-space` or by triggering the `editor::ShowCompletions` action from the command palette.
